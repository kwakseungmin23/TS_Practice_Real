Wrap Up
Javascript uses runtime types, Typescript uses static types that matter during development.
Javascript doesn't include any type assignments.
We had look a numbers, strings, booleans, function types, setting return types,
arguments types, also describing the type of an overall function which can be
helpful if you wanna have variable that eventually holds a function.
We had a look at objects and arrays and enums, tuples.
Aliases, types aliases, merge complex types into aliases that we can reuse.
we had look at literal types, union types.
unknown and never.

Wrap Up Typescript Compiler & Configuration
We had a very detailed look at the typescript compiler.
How you can configure it, how to make sure that it really compiles your code the way you want.
All these different ts options,
strict options, really allow you to write correct code and not run into strange bugs.
We had a look at debugging, how to easily configure Chrome, debug using sourcemap option.
